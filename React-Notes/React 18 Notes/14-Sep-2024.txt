		                  Routing in React
- Routing is technique used in web applications to configure user and SEO friendly URL's.

Without Route:
   https://www.amazon.in/products.html?category=electronics&product=mobile&model=samsung

With Route:
   https://www.amazon.in/electronics/mobile/samsung

- User friendly URL allows to query any content directly from address bar.
- SEO friendly URL allows SEO to find and access the exact location of user in page.
- Route enables navigation in SPA, where user can stay on one page and get access to everything from the page.
- Route uses Ajax calls, which can load new content into page without reloading the page.
- Routing is implemented both 
	a) Server Side
	b) Client Side
- React is using routes client side.
- Client side route allows to access and render a component from one page.

React Routing Library:
- React Router DOM is the library for routing. [ react-router-dom ]
- Router DOM library V5 [Version 5] is used in react up to 17x versions.
- Router DOM Version 6 is latest and it is a complete re-write of routing. 

1. Install Router DOM library

	>npm install react-router-dom  --save

2. Route Table is created by using <BrowserRouter> component 

3. Router Table contains a collection of  Routes defined with <Routes> component.

4. Every Individual Route in routes collection is defined with <Route> component.

Syntax:
	<BrowserRouter>
	    <Routes>
	          <Route />
	          <Route />
	    </Routes>
	</BrowserRouter>

5. Each Route is defined with various attributes

	a) path
	b) element
	c) children 
	d) outLet

Note: <BrowserRouter> is responsible for mapping the Virtual Routes into Actual DOM
          Routes. It maps with browser "location" object, which handles the navigation.
	
           Hence make sure that all router components are defined within the scope of
           <BrowserRouter>

Syntax:
	<Route  path="requestName"   element={ <Component /> }  />
	<Route  path="requestName"  element={<markup> JSX </markup>}  />

- You can configure wild card routes that define what to render according to situation.

	<Route path="/" />	 It renders element when user request is empty.
	<Route path="*" />	 It renders element when user request not found.

Note: Make sure that the wild card route "*" is configured at the end of rotues collection.


- You can configure navigation to any route by using <Link> component.

	<Link to="pathName"> Text | Image .. </Link>

Ex:
1. Go to App.js

import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
import { EMICalculator } from './components/emi-calculator/emi-calculator';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="container-fluid">
       <BrowserRouter>
          <header className='bg-dark d-flex justify-content-around text-white p-2'>
              <div className='fs-5 fw-bold'>Shopper.</div>
              <div className='fs-4' >  
                 <Link to="/" className='link-light text-decoration-none'> Home </Link>
                 <Link to="men" className='link-light text-decoration-none mx-3'> Men's Fashion </Link>
                 <Link to="women" className='link-light text-decoration-none mx-3'> Women's Fashion </Link>
                 <Link to="kids" className='link-light text-decoration-none'> Kid's Fashion </Link>
                 <Link to="emi" className='link-light mx-2 text-decoration-none'> EMI </Link>
              </div>
              <div>
                <span className='bi bi-person-fill'></span>
                <span className='bi bi-heart-fill mx-3'></span>
                <span className='bi bi-cart'></span>
              </div>
          </header>
          <section className='mt-4'>
              <Routes>
                  <Route path='/' element={<div><h1>Welcome to online shopping</h1><p>Men's | Women | Kids Fashion</p></div>} />
                  <Route path='men' element={<div><h3>Men's Fashion</h3><img src="men-fashion.jpg" width="200" height="200"/></div>} />
                  <Route path='women' element={<div><h3>Women's Fashion</h3><img src="women-fashion.jpg" width="200" height="200"/></div>} />
                  <Route path='kids' element={<div><h3>Kid's Fashion</h3><img src="kids-fashion.jpg" width="200" height="200"/></div>} />
                  <Route path='emi' element={<EMICalculator />} />
                  <Route path='*' element={<div><h3 className='text-warning'>Looking for something?</h3><code>Sorry unable to find your request</code></div>} />
              </Routes>
          </section>
       </BrowserRouter>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
